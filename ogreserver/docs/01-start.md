Summary: So WTF is all this then?


### Intro

Welcome to O.G.R.E.

If you didn't already know, this is platform for sharing ebooks that mafro has been working on for a few years. If you're reading this, then it's finally live!


### Start Downloading

You can head straight to [O.G.R.E.](/) home and start downloading books! (For help getting them onto your Kindle, [head over here](/docs/kindle).)


### Start Contributing

A little bit of setup is required to start contributing to the O.G.R.E. movement, so find an hour and get involved - see [installing ogreclient](/docs/ogreclient).
