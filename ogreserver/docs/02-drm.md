Summary: Some commentary on the ills of DRM


### Why say no to DRM?

When you pay for a DRM-crippled book, you aren't "buying" a book in the traditional sense; you're making a one-time payment for the right to read a piece of text. This right can be revoked at any time - according to Amazon's Kindle Store terms of use, "Kindle content is licensed, not sold". [^1]  [^2]

Since words were first published people have shared them. The first book you read as a child from your parents bookshelf. The smell of yellowed pages in a 1950's sci-fi book from a second hand store. Picking up a discarded newspaper on a train. DRM will put a stop to all these things - once the words are digitally managed, our rights are removed.

### Stallman on DRM

From the inimitable Richard Stallman[^3]:

"Every product with Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) is an attack on your freedom.

Therefore, one should not buy or tolerate any product with DRM handcuffs unless one personally possesses the means to break the handcuffs. For instance, don't use encrypted DVDs unless you play them using DeCSS or another comparable free program. And never use a Bluray disk unless you find a way to break its handcuffs."
